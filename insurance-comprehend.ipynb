    "Comprehend Builtin features:\n",
    "* Entities detection – extract a a list of entities, such as people, places, and locations, identified in a document.\n",
    "* Key phrases detection – extracts key phrases that appear in a document.\n",
    "* PII information detection – analyzes and detect personal data that could be used to identify an individual, such as an address, bank account number, or phone number.\n",
    "* Determine Language – the dominant language in a document.\n",
    "* Determine Sentiment – the emotional sentiment of a document.\n",
    "* Syntax Processing – parses each word in your document and determines the part of speech for the word. For example, in the sentence \"It is raining today in Seattle,\" \"it\" is identified as a pronoun, \"raining\" is identified as a verb, and \"Seattle\" is identified as a proper noun.\n",
    "* Custom classifier - you can also build our own classifier by providing content and matching classification.\n",
    "* Topic modeling - organize a large corpus of documents into topics or clusters that are similar based on the frequency of words within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehend supports both synchronous and batch API calls, so it can be used for large scale processing as well as realtime results.\n"
